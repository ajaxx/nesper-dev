    /// MonitorLock is a class for assisting people with synchronized operations.
    /// Traditionally, code might have looked something like this:
    /// <code>
    /// lock( object ) { 
    ///   ...
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// However, this has a few issues.  It's prone to deadlock because the lock
    /// operator does not have a timeout.  It's also difficult to determine who
    /// owns a lock at a given time.  So eventually people changed to this form:
    /// <code>
    /// if (Monitor.TryEnter(object, timeout)) {
    ///   try {
    ///    ...
    ///   } finally {
    ///     Monitor.Exit(object);
    ///   }
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// It gets bulky and begins to become difficult to maintain over time.
    /// MonitorLock works much like the lock( object ) model except that it relies
    /// upon the IDisposable interface to help with scoping of the lock.  So to
    /// use MonitorLock, first instantiate one and then replace your lock(object)
    /// with this:
    /// <code>
    /// using(lockObj.Acquire()) {
    ///   ...
    /// }
    /// </code>
    /// Your code will work as before except that the monitorLock will use a timed
    /// entry into critical sections and it can be used to diagnose issues that
    /// may be occuring in your thread locking.
    /// <para>
    /// MonitorLock allows users to specify events that can be consumed on lock
    /// acquisition or release.  Additionally, it can inform you when a lock
    /// is acquired within an existing lock.  And last, if you want to know where
    /// your locks are being acquired, it can maintain a StackTrace of points
    /// where allocations are occuring.
