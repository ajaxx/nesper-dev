    /// ImperfectBlockingQueue is a blocking queue designed for very high performance exchanges
    /// between threads.  Multiple readers and writers can exchange information using the
    /// ImperfectBlockingQueue.  The design allows for a read node and a write node.  Both the
    /// read node and write node are assumed to be probablistically incorrect at any given time.
    /// Specifically, that means that the read node may have actually been processed and the
    /// write node may not actually be the tail.  Rather than attempting to correct for this 
    /// imperfection in the data structure, we leverage it.
    /// <para/>
    /// When a writer attempts to write to the tail, the tail uses an atomic compare-exchange
    /// to exchange the next node with the newly allocated node.  If the exchange fails, the 
    /// thread will iterate through the next member until it finds null and the cycle continue
    /// again with the atomic compare-exchange.  Using this method, the writer will succeed
    /// in writing to the tail atomically.  The write node does not need to accurately reflect
    /// the true end of tail, so adjusting the write node to the written node is "reasonably"
    /// accurate.
    /// <para/>
    /// When a reader attempts to read from the head, an atomic compare exchange is used to
    /// test against the "IsProcessed" field of the node.  If the node has been processed, then
    /// the reader moves on to the next node until it can successfully perform a CAS against
    /// the node.  If none can be found, the method will force a sleep to simulate a block.
    /// Once found, the reader extracts the value for return and sets the head equal to the
    /// node just read.  Again, since we're probablistic, this is fine.  Since we've successfully
    /// read from the node, we're assured that all nodes before us have been processed.  Being
    /// "reasonably" accurate with the read node is fine since the next reader will simply
    /// advance from this point.
    /// <para/>
    /// This class was tested against various concurrent reader/writer models was equal to or
    /// outperformed all other models in all cases.  However, it still appears that during
    /// tight iterations that there is about a 4-1 call ratio between CAS and the Push method
    /// which means there is still some efficiency to be squeezed out.
